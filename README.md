<h3><i>Your risk for heart disease increases with age, especially for those who are over 85. While the average age for a heart attack is 64.5 for men, and 70.3 for women, nearly 20 percent of those who die of heart disease are under the age of 65.. </h2>

<h2> Data

<h3> This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4

<br> <br> <br>


<h2> Problem Statemtent
<h3>By using these data we have to Predict wheather a patient is suffering from heart disease or not based on different parameters

<br> <br> <br>

<h2>Business objectives and constraints
<h3>1. The cost of a mis-classification can be high.
<h3>2. There is some latency concerns.
